This folder consists of three files: a bash script for downloading, a python program for extracting data using DOM and 
inserting to mysql database, and a PHP script for presentation using the Apache web server.

Write a Bash script to download the stock web page every minute for an hour. Make sure you do this between 9:30 am and 4 pm 
when the values change. Your bash script will call a python program.

Complete the injection part which injects data into MySql database. You need to install a mysql database server if not already
installed and get it up and running. Check mysql.org for tutorials on how to install and use.

Write a PHP script to retrieve data from the mysql database and present them on a browser. The tables will be clickable and
sortable like the ones I showed in class. You need to install Apache server if not already installed.

Submit a tgz file of the following: - python source code mysql (maria) for inserting data - php source code for Apache - screenshot
of mysql table displayed within mysql environment - screenshot of the web page displaying the table - this must match the page displayed
by mysql select.
